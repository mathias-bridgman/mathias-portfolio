          <p>
            I made this in week 6 of Bootcamp its a good example of fullStack
            design as it uses fullstack design methods. I decided to make this
            because I wanted something that me and family/friends could use too
            put photos and a small blurb about certain memories we want to
            remember. it also has given me a canvas and base too work off when I
            want to expand and practise new coding ideas.

          <p>
            this was the first group project that I made in Bootcamp we had just
            learnt some SQL database and experimented with using that newfound
            knowledge too make an inticing travel brochure of sorts. we worked
            in a team of 5 creating our plan and idea and pair programmed when
            we got around to the coding.
