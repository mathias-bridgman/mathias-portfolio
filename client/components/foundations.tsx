            I made this blog site in Dev Academy's foundations. it has a lot of
            the learnings I did in foundations as well as being the first site I
            made entirely from scratch.

          <p>
            this was a game that I fixed in the last week of foundations it took
            me a while to figure out but was very rewarding when completed. it
            gave me a great idea of what game design would look like. you will
            need to open this on your own computer and run a live server too see
            the game.
